# Subnet Genie

Subnet Genie is a ReactJS application that allows users to calculate subnets using both the FLSM (Fixed-length subnet mask) and VLSM (Variable-length subnet mask) methods. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering network address and CIDR prefix length, and displays the calculated subnet mask, broadcast address, usable host range, and wildcard mask for both FLSM and VLSM methods.

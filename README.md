# 🌐 Subnet Genie

**Subnet Genie** is a ReactJS application that allows users to calculate subnets using both the **FLSM** (Fixed-Length Subnet Mask) and **VLSM** (Variable-Length Subnet Mask) methods. It provides a user-friendly interface for entering the network address and CIDR prefix length, and displays the calculated subnet mask, broadcast address, usable host range, and wildcard mask for both FLSM and VLSM methods.
